## WEB FRAMEWORK

The general idea is to have two classes a Model Class and View Class with separate responsibilities. 

## Model Class
  - Handle data
  - Used to represent Users, Blog post, Comments, Images etc...
  
  ## View Class
  - Handle HTML and events cause by the user (clicks, typing, etc...)
